This is one of my first projects that I learned to do from watching some creators on youtube. 
I figured, why not make my first project a sample of the very first video game ever created.

The game is simple. Two players paddle a ball back and forth using four keys on the keyboard:
  's' and 'w' for the left hand player.
  'up arrow' and 'down arrow' for the right.
 
 I personally enjoy the sound effect...
